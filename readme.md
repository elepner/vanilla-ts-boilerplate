# Vanilla typescript project

Boilerplate project for vanilla typescript development for educational purposes when one does not need any new and fancy UI framework.

Features:

1. Typescript compiler for compiling and packaging code (no webpack voodoo).
1. Native typescript capabilities to watch files and automatic rebuild.
1. Unit tests with mocha with configured [mocha vscode adapter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-mocha-test-adapter).

How to build and launch?

0. Have one of not too old nodejs installed on your machine
1. ``npm i``
2. ``npm run dev``
3. Use [live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) VS Code extension to serve your files locally.
